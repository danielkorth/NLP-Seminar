# The effect of fine-tuning models for duplicate detection in the context of software engineering
In this seminar I worked on the task of detecting duplicates in software bug reports. Specifically I compared how the dataset used for fine-tuning affects performance. All of the results and code are documented in my [Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/danielkorth/NLP-Seminar/blob/main/Semantic_Duplicates.ipynb).
